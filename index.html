            <p>I guess you think you know this story.<br>
You don't. The real one's much more gory.<br>
The phoney one, the one you know,<br>
Was cooked up years and years ago,<br>
And made to sound all soft and sappy<br>
just to keep the children happy.<br>
Mind you, they got the first bit right,<br>
The bit where, in the dead of night,<br>
The Ugly Sisters, jewels and all,<br>
Departed for the Palace Ball,<br>
While darling little Cinderella<br>
Was locked up in a slimy cellar,<br>
Where rats who wanted things to eat,<br>
Began to nibble at her feet.<br>
<br>
She bellowed 'Help!' and 'Let me out!<br>
The Magic Fairy heard her shout.<br>
Appearing in a blaze of light,<br>
She said: 'My dear, are you all right?'<br>
'All right?' cried Cindy .'Can't you see<br>
'I feel as rotten as can be!'<br>
She beat her fist against the wall,<br>
And shouted, 'Get me to the Ball!<br>
'There is a Disco at the Palace!<br>
'The rest have gone and I am jealous!<br>
'I want a dress! I want a coach!<br>
'And earrings and a diamond brooch!<br>
'And silver slippers, two of those!<br>
'And lovely nylon panty hose!<br>
'Done up like that I'll guarantee<br>
'The handsome Prince will fall for me!'<br>
The Fairy said, 'Hang on a tick.'<br>
She gave her wand a mighty flick<br>
And quickly, in no time at all,<br>
Cindy was at the Palace Ball!<br>
<br>
It made the Ugly Sisters wince<br>
To see her dancing with the Prince.<br>
She held him very tight and pressed<br>
herself against his manly chest.<br>
The Prince himself was turned to pulp,<br>
All he could do was gasp and gulp.<br>
Then midnight struck. She shouted, 'Heck!<br>
I've got to run to save my neck!'<br>
The Prince cried, 'No! Alas! Alack!'<br>
He grabbed her dress to hold her back.<br>
As Cindy shouted, 'Let me go!'<br>
The dress was ripped from head to toe.<br>
<br>
She ran out in her underwear,<br>
And lost one slipper on the stair.<br>
The Prince was on it like a dart,<br>
He pressed it to his pounding heart,<br>
'The girl this slipper fits,' he cried,<br>
'Tomorrow morn shall be my bride!<br>
I'll visit every house in town<br>
'Until I've tracked the maiden down!'<br>
Then rather carelessly, I fear,<br>
He placed it on a crate of beer.<br>
<br>
At once, one of the Ugly Sisters,<br>
(The one whose face was blotched with blisters)<br>
Sneaked up and grabbed the dainty shoe,<br>
And quickly flushed it down the loo.<br>
Then in its place she calmly put<br>
The slipper from her own left foot.<br>
Ah ha, you see, the plot grows thicker,<br>
And Cindy's luck starts looking sicker.<br>
<br>
Next day, the Prince went charging down<br>
To knock on all the doors in town.<br>
In every house, the tension grew.<br>
Who was the owner of the shoe?<br>
The shoe was long and very wide.<br>
(A normal foot got lost inside.)<br>
Also it smelled a wee bit icky.<br>
(The owner's feet were hot and sticky.)<br>
Thousands of eager people came<br>
To try it on, but all in vain.<br>
Now came the Ugly Sisters' go.<br>
One tried it on. The Prince screamed, 'No!'<br>
But she screamed, 'Yes! It fits! Whoopee!<br>
'So now you've got to marry me!'<br>
The Prince went white from ear to ear.<br>
He muttered, 'Let me out of here.'<br>
'Oh no you don't! You made a vow!<br>
'There's no way you can back out now!'<br>
'Off with her head!' The Prince roared back.<br>
They chopped it off with one big whack.<br>
This pleased the Prince. He smiled and said,<br>
'She's prettier without her head.'<br>
Then up came Sister Number Two,<br>
Who yelled, 'Now I will try the shoe!'<br>
'Try this instead!' the Prince yelled back.<br>
He swung his trusty sword and smack<br>
Her head went crashing to the ground.<br>
It bounced a bit and rolled around.<br>
In the kitchen, peeling spuds,<br>
Cinderella heard the thuds<br>
Of bouncing heads upon the floor,<br>
And poked her own head round the door.<br>
'What's all the racket? 'Cindy cried.<br>
'Mind your own bizz,' the Prince replied.<br>
Poor Cindy's heart was torn to shreds.<br>
My Prince! she thought. He chops off heads!<br>
How could I marry anyone<br>
Who does that sort of thing for fun?<br>
<br>
The Prince cried, 'Who's this dirty slut?<br>
'Off with her nut! Off with her nut!'<br>
Just then, all in a blaze of light,<br>
The Magic Fairy hove in sight,<br>
Her Magic Wand went swoosh and swish!<br>
'Cindy! 'she cried, 'come make a wish!<br>
'Wish anything and have no doubt<br>
'That I will make it come about!'<br>
Cindy answered, 'Oh kind Fairy,<br>
'This time I shall be more wary.<br>
'No more Princes, no more money.<br>
'I have had my taste of honey.<br>
I'm wishing for a decent man.<br>
'They're hard to find. D'you think you can?'<br>
Within a minute, Cinderella<br>
Was married to a lovely feller,<br>
A simple jam maker by trade,<br>
Who sold good home-made marmalade.<br>
Their house was filled with smiles and laughter<br>
And they were happy ever after. <br>
